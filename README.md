# java-practice
This is a repository that I created to store my java practice projects. Through practice, I hope to improve my java skills and create some interesting applications.

## Game of Life
The Game of Life project is an application that displays a visualization of Conway's Game of Life. Through this project, I am hoping to gain experience with using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Java Swing, while at the same time practicing my code organization skills.
