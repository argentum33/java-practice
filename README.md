# java-practice
This is a repository that I created to store my java practice projects. Through practice, I hope to continue to improve my java skills and create some interesting applications.

## Game of Life
The Game of Life project is an application that displays a visualization of Conway's Game of Life. Through this project, I am hoping to gain experience with using Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Java Swing, while at the same time practicing my code organization skills. For this particular project, I have chosen to use the Model-View-Controller pattern to organize my application's code.

### Setup Instructions
At the moment, this application requires nothing special in terms of installation. You can simply download and run it as you would any simple java project.

### Current Tasks
* Improve the look of the user interface
* Add some interactive options
  * Changing the application colors
  * Pausing the simulation
  * Allowing the user to create his or her own map
